Consolidating in a public simple site the content and guides that the old me would have loved when starting with linux. Hope that this will make the start of your Linux journey a better experience.

Web version of the outputs generated by the code posted on <https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Linux>.

Please feel free to copy, modify, distribute and suggest any further improvements on the content.

Due to the increasing importance of containerized application running on Docker, there will be mentions on this page to my guides on both:
* My Docker repository: <https://github.com/JAlcocerT/Docker>.
* My blog: <https://fossengineer.com/tags/docker/>

This page was generated previously using the knitr package from R, now - its updated for improved readability to a Hugo theme and deployed with Github actions on this public repository.
