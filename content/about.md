Consolidating my **Notes about Linux** in a public simple site the content and guides that the old me would have loved when starting with linux.

**The page is dedicated to my cousin.**

Around the year ~2006 he was the first one to show me the Linux ecosystem.

Which at that time, it was too chaotic for me, despite his great guidance.

I kept using only Windows until ~2020, were I gave Linux another try and suddenly, this site exists, hoping to help many others.

Hope that these guides will make the **Start of your Linux Journey** a better experience.
