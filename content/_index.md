If you are reading it, you are not like others.

You like not only to think different, but act different - That brought you here.



## Why Linux?

{{% details title="Awsome Question to Start! 🚀" closed="true" %}}

Linux is highly customizable, allowing users to tailor the operating system to their own needs and preferences.

The **open-source** nature of Linux makes it easy for developers to create applications and tools that are compatible with this operating system.

* A better understanding of how computers work: Linux is a **Unix-based operating system**, which means that it is built on top of the Unix kernel. Unix is a very powerful and versatile operating system, and learning Linux will give you a better understanding of how computers work at a lower level.

* The ability to work on a variety of platforms: Linux is available on a wide variety of platforms, including desktops, laptops, servers (Cloud), and even embedded systems. Learning Linux will give you the ability to work on a **variety of platforms** without having to learn different operating systems.

* Learn Linux to gain control over your system’s **privacy and security**, thanks to its open-source nature and robust security architecture.

And that's right, providing that globally ~70% of market share in smartphones goes to **Android**.

Surprise! [Android is an **Open Source OS**](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/#im-an-android-user) which uses the **Linux Kernel** (the very core of it).

Whatever fight you might have heard with Google Services, commercial battles etc, it doesn't change that anyone can use Android and that most likely, you have one near you.

Linux is an **open-source operating system** that is used in a variety of devices, from embedded systems to cloud computing. It is highly secure, reliable, and efficient, making it an ideal choice for a range of applications.

## Wait I have some Questions

I Know, I know, you are not sure to get Started with Linux.

If these are some QQ that come to your mind right now, dont let that stop you to show others what you are capable of 🔥

{{% details title="Do I have to do stuff with the terminal?" closed="true" %}}

No, **you dont have to**. But you will love to.

If you are in the beginning of the journey, I recommend to to start with Debian and [install your favourite apps with .deb packages](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/debian/linux_installing_apps/#ui). **Just double click the downloaded file**.

That was not that hard right? You can also give it a try to [snap](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/debian/linux_installing_apps/#snap).

**Warning**: you might feel like a hacker 🙊

{{% details title="Isn't it better to use mac/windows?" closed="true" %}}

It is true that Windows or Mac had a better learning curve some years ago than Linux. But **today, Linux is just as easy to use**.

Additionally, Linux is community built so you are more certain that there are no lock-up incentives into such software, like *it could happend* with proprietary OS's.

Plus, in the information era, it is quite clear than a **decentralized network of free minds collaborating** can thrive progress much more efficiently than hierarchical and close organizations. 


{{< callout type="info" >}}
A note regarding costs: **think of money just as signals**.

* Organizations need some kind of licensing / hook you into their Software as a Service to be able to continue providing their product/service.

* Same applies for Linux and F/OSS in general - there are people behind all of this Software and thanks to **voluntary support**, aka donations, we can let know to this generous people that what they are doing, is valuable to us and that we are interested that they continue to do so.

{{% details title="Decentralized? Isn't it that Crypto stuff?" closed="true" %}}

We can think of Linux as an OS built in a Decentralized way.

And yes, **crypto like Bitcoin**, is basically a decentralized information system. Nobody is in control, there are **simple rules and agents interacting** according to them.

But we should remember that **Science's nature is also Decentralized**. Anyone can propose, question or test the Current status Quo.
