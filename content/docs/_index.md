## How to Start my Linux Journey

{{% steps %}}

### Download Ubuntu

Ubuntu is a Debian based Linux. 

Quite user friendly. And you can [Download for free here](https://ubuntu.com/download).

<!-- <div class="mb-6">
{{< hextra/hero-button text="Get Ubuntu" link="https://ubuntu.com/download" >}}
</div> -->

### Try Ubuntu in a VM

Whatever happens to the Virtual Machine, it does not matter and wont affect your main OS.

So try things, install your favourite Apps!

### Ways Install your Apps

Yes, you can just do double click to .deb files.

Additionally, you can find awsome Apps here:

* Snap Store: <https://snapcraft.io/store>
* Flathub: <https://flathub.org/>

Plot twist - They are also Free.

### Forget about Hard Formats

That thing of the CLI must have some advantage, right?

Yes, once you know what you need - you can make your device work for you, instead of letting it be your master

Make your life easier from now on with:

* Some [script to install](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/debian/linux_installing_apps/) the Apps for you
* [Get Docker](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/debian/docker/) and [Start SelfHosting](https://fossengineer.com/tags/self-hosting/)
* Automating your [System Setup with Ansible](https://jalcocert.github.io/Linux/docs/linux__cloud.md/ansible/)

### How to use Android from Linux?

#### KDE Connected

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install kdeconnect
```

Then check devices with the UI or with CLI:

```sh
kdeconnect-cli --refresh
kdeconnect-cli --list-devices
```

You can get it from: <https://f-droid.org/packages/org.kde.kdeconnect_tp/>

Alternatively, you have GSConnect or scrcpy:

```sh
sudo apt install scrcpy
```

  {{< tab >}}If you are wondering why should it be so painfull to install all your favourite Apps in Windows, you are in a good place.

Making clean install is really simple in Linux thanks to Tools like: Ansible, Docker (you can also use it) or scripts.

> Yes, you also can use **Chocolatey GUI** and avoid the scripting part.

{{% details title="You can use Scripts in Windows as well, together with Chocolatey! üç´ " closed="true" %}}


### Chocolatey What?

Ok - this is suposed to be Linux related only, but I discovered about this and if there is some Windows user reading this, probably will be wondering if formating and setup a Windows machine from scratch has to be so painful.

**Chocolatey is a F/OSS package manager** for Windows that enables users to **easily install**, manage, and update software applications from the command line or through a graphical interface.

**Package WHAT?**

When you want new tools or games, instead of roaming the internet, you tell the package manager what you desire. This *shopkeeper* knows where to find them, handles all the downloading and setup, and even keeps them updated so you don't have to worry about dusty shelves. 

### Installing Chocolatey üöÄ

Get Chocolatey ready and forget about being afraid to format C your Windows ever again.

```sh
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

You can use it with Graphical User Interface:

```sh
choco install chocolateygui
#chocolateygui
```

#### Using Chocolatey

Navigate to **<https://community.chocolatey.org/packages>** and look for the packages that you are interested:

```sh
# Check if Chocolatey is installed
if (-not (Get-Command choco -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)) {
    Write-Host "Chocolatey is not installed. Installing Chocolatey..."
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
}

# Install Chrome
Write-Host "Installing Google Chrome..."
choco install googlechrome -y

# Install Steam
Write-Host "Installing Steam..."
choco install steam -y

# Install Visual Studio Code
Write-Host "Installing Visual Studio Code..."
choco install vscode -y

Write-Host "Installation completed."
```

Useful commands:

```sh
choco search packageName: Search for packages by name.
choco install packageName: Install a package.
choco list --local-only: List all installed packages.
choco uninstall packageName: Uninstall a package.
choco upgrade packageName: Upgrade a package to the latest version.
```

Create a list like [this one](https://gist.github.com/JAlcocerT/76f22ddf886277ef2653f82898c634d8) with your favourite Apps , then use it from the powershell.

> The logic here is Work Smart. Do once, re-use forever ‚ôªÔ∏è
