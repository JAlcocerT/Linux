## FAQ

### How to send files to Android TV?

We can use [LocalSend](https://github.com/localsend/localsend?tab=readme-ov-file#download), a F/OSS cross-platform alternative to AirDrop.

Install it with [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/org.localsend.localsend_app):

```sh
flatpak install flathub org.localsend.localsend_app
```

And send that F-Droid APK to your Android TV - Then enjoy any of the apps available in there.
