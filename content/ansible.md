# Ansible, Why?

Ansible is an automation tool that simplifies the management and configuration of servers, applications, and infrastructure. It allows you to define tasks in plain text, automate repetitive operations, and ensure consistent system configurations across your network.

**An Automation tool?**

> Imagine having a magical assistant that can perform complex tasks for you without breaking a sweat. You simply describe what you want, and this assistant takes care of the rest, ensuring your systems are always in tip-top shape. That's the power of automation, and Ansible is your digital assistant.

#sudo apt update
